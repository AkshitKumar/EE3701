    Hardware experiments on switch and LED
	
1.  Turn on one of the eight LEDs and rotate it in a Round-Robin
    fashion.

2. Read the 8-bit switch data. Split it into two nibbles. 
   Add them and display the result on the LEDs. See that 
   the sum has a carry and display it.
   
3. Set up  a combination lock on the 8-bit DIP switch. 
   Given a bit pattern in the program, the LEDs has to
   turn on  only if the correct combination is set on the 
   DIP switch.
