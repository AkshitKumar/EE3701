		Serial Communication and ADC
1.  Read the serial communication and ADC sections in the LPC2378 data sheet. Go through the program  and understand the configuration of the registers. 
2.  Explain the statements in the programs to the TA with  particular emphasis on the configuration register values and the while loops used for checking.
3.  In serial communication do the following modifications
        (i)  Send a character from the PC and display its ascii value on the LEDs on the Kit. If it is a Hexadecimal character then display the actual value.
        (ii)  Read the 8-way DIP switch and display the value on the PC
4. In ADC, configure the ADC to operate with a resolution of 4 bits .
